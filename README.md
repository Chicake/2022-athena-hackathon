# Athena Hackathon Group Project on October 2022

Me, Ana, Jeeann, Joanne and Victoria worked together to come up with solution on the project provided by Blackrock on: "Improving Financial Inclusivity." This repository contains our idea product, Banktree's figma demo, python demo and presentation PDF. Figma shows the front-end and python shows rough back-end.
