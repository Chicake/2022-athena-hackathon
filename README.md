# Athena Hackathon Group Project on October 2022

Me, Ana, Jeeann, Joanne and Victoria worked together to come up with solution on the project provided by Blackrock on: "Improving Financial Inclusivity." This repository contains our idea product, Banktree's figma demo, [python demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KDRexmicSDmrbyjWXn8J816_I5UQDxNf?usp=sharing) and presentation PDF. Figma shows the front-end and python shows rough back-end.
